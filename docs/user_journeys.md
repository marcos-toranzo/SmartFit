# User Journeys

Due to the collaborative nature of the app, the users will be divided into two main roles: those who contribute and those who consume. They are not exclusive, and there are not strictly separated, since the actions of contributing and consuming are done seamlessly.

The **contributors** are the users that submit and upload routines, as well as give feedback to other routines from other users. Those that provide personal and private information to the app are not considered contributors since that information is not shared across every user on the platform.

On the other hand, we have the **consumer**. These users are the ones that use the services, basically, without giving feedback or uploading routines, i.e. downloading routines, watching reviews and feedbacks from other users, or using personal features like the history or tracking system. They are the ones that make the most use of the recommendation and optimization systems.

We could describe some situations where these roles are clearly expressed:

## User journey 1:

1. A user gets home after work. He traveled by foot 2 miles to get there and back home, so he/she doesn't feel like doing any legs exercises today.
2. The user opens the app and decides to look for routines where the legs are not exercised.
3. The system finds a list of these routines, ordered by positive feedback from users and how good of a match is with the request (less leg work as possible).
4. The user chooses one and decides to do it.
5. The app then shows the different exercises and the steps to follow to finish the routine.

## User journey 2:

1. A user works as a tourist guide when he/she has to travel a lot by car.
2. He/she wants to exercise the lower back due to the bad posture during the day and the legs since they were not used for long periods at once.
3. The user goes into the app but can't find exactly what he/she is looking for.
4. The user then proceeds to create his/her own routine and uploads it to the system, hoping to help someone else.
5. The user uploads the exercises that are part of the routines, as well as each step to complete for each exercise.
6. The user adds tags like: `day driving`, `bad lower back posture` and `for inactive legs`.
7. The user adds the description: _For when you spent the whole day driving_.
8. The user adds a workout table indicating the amount of work each exercise of the routine does on the parts of the body. This is a number between 0 and 100, from none to full workout. In this case adds: `Legs -> 90`, `Lower Back -> 70`.
9. Now that routine is available for every user to use, share, like and give feedback to.

## User journey 3:

1. A user wants the know which parts of the body have received the less workout with the idea of giving them a priority.
2. The user proceeds to check the history on the app, where it shows this information in more detail. He/she sees that what is missing is a lot of shoulder exercising.
3. The user then decides to look for routines focused specifically on the shoulders.
4. The user finds one that fits perfectly.
5. The user finishes de routine and decides to give positive feedback about the routine giving it a Like.
6. Now, other users will know that someone else found that routine useful and will maybe check it out.

## User journey 4:

1. The user has been skipping leg work for over a week.
2. The app tracks this information and notifies the user.
3. The user opens the app and finds a whole range of routines for exercising the legs.
4. The user selects one and does it.

## User journey 5:

1. The user enters his/her weekly schedule in the app, indicating what kind of work does each day. For example, from Monday to Thursday he/she works as an assistant for a mechanic in a shop. He/she specifies that, since he/she has to work in uncomfortable positions, he/she would like to exercise the back those days.
2. The user gets home one Tuesday and the app automatically suggests back exercises, based on the information provided by the user.

## User journey 6:

1. The user has been using his lower part of the body a lot during 8 hours, but not the ankles and the legs have suffered more than the abdomen, so he decides to look for a routine that matches these requirements, maybe one that exercises a little bit the abdomen, almost nothing or none the legs and works a lot the arms.
2. To do that, the user enters a number between 0 (nothing at all) and 100 (full workout) for each part of the body. He enters: Abdomen -> 30, Legs -> 0, Biceps -> 80, Triceps -> 70, Chest -> 30.
3. The system with this information will look for routines that match these requirements and show them to the user.
4. The user selects one and does the routine.
