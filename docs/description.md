# Description

When you are on a strict workout plan, or just want to stay fit, but you have to balance this with a lot of other daily activities that also make you tired both physically and mentally, this app comes to play.

The idea is to focus not just on the specific workout routines to make you develop your fitness, but also on the fact that you spent the rest of the day doing other kinds of exercise, maybe walking to work or college and back home, or maybe you work in a warehouse, where you have to move lots and lots of cargo around and you can get tired, and even injured if not handled correctly.

To avoid this, you need to manually and carefully plan your workout, trying not to overdo some areas of the body that may have been working extensively during the day. This could get even more complicated when you are not sure which parts of the body some specific routine exercises and can't tell if it would be good for you.

With the app, you can just enter what areas you feel more tired or exercised during the day, or what kind of work you've been doing, and the app will find the right routines for you. These could be found either by just looking at a database, or applying different recommendation techniques based on that data. For example, the app could make a profile based on your needs and look for the most liked routines based on comments or other criteria about these routines that some other users posted. In addition, the app could also optimize these findings to get to the best routine that would fit you, even when it is not exactly one existing in the database, trying to achieve maximum exercise while minimizing excess muscular fatigue and injury.
