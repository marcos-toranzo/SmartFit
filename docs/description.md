# Description

This aims to reduce typical pains related to bad posture, excessive walking or bad techniques when doing heavy liftings, all related to our daily routines and things we can not always control, like going to work or college. This way, we can balance what we did during the day, and what we should do the rest of the day in order to stay fit and healthy.

In order to achive this goal, the app will have to resort to a system where it can propose the best workout routines based on the input the users give about their day. This could be done through presets, when the users set their weekly or monthly schedule and the app already knows what should be the best routines for each day or moment of the day. These recomendations could be highly improved if we allow the users to enter their feedback about the recomendations they receive, as well as to propose their own routines. This way, each user would have a more personalized experience where he/her can share it with the rest of them, hoping to help and get helped at the same time.
