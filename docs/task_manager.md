# Task Manager

For this project, we decided to use [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) as the task manager for the repo. The decision was based on how popular Make is across the community, having a strong foundation due to its longevity and constant contribution to the project from a lot of developers. Make is also really easy to use, not requiring much knowledge about specific technologies or tools. It also comes preinstalled in a lot of operative system distributions, mostly in Linux-based distros. Many other Task Managers have adopted its style and syntax, so moving from Make to another one wouldn't be so difficult. It is not language-specific, so if the project decides to move in another direction about the languages to use, Make wouldn't be an issue.

Other managers were also considered, like [SCons](https://www.scons.org/), used by some important projects, or [Waf](https://gitlab.com/ita1024/waf/), being suggested in some forums, but those are not as widespread as Make and could add an extra layer to the learning process, or [doit](https://pydoit.org/) that is powered by and written in python, but this makes the task manager "dependent" on python, and even tho this could mean a better and solid integration, if the project decides to use other languages too, the fact that this task manager is written in python loses meaning.
